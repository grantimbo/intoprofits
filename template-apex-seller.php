			<h4>What is Apex Seller™?</h4>
			<p>Apex Seller is a comprehensive 6-week training package that shows you how to scale a private label business into 7- and 8-figures, while designing it to run and grow without you.</p>
			
			<h4>Who is it for?</h4>
			<p>Apex Seller is for private label sellers on Amazon that are already in business and making sales. It is for sellers that want to scale up and grow into 7- and 8-figures.</p>
			
			<h4>How does it work?</h4>
			<p>The program starts the moment you enroll. Go through the training step-by-step, implement the workflows, ask questions when you need help, and get results.</p>
			
			<h4>Why does it exist?</h4>
			<p>Apex Seller exists because most established sellers are clueless when it comes to professional private label systems, scaling up, hiring & managing a team, and making things predictable, data-driven and consistent.</p>

		<h1 class="apex-section-title">Complete & Connected</h1>
		<p class="apex-section-description">Forged in fire, our systems have evolved through continuous application since 2012. Most programs teach you siloed tactics but in the real-world everything is connected. And it’s the correct combination of every component that produces stunning results.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Focus</b>
				<p>Knowing what works and where to invest your time, energy and resources is critical for success. Most sellers get distracted and waste time where the ROI is low to none.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Product strategy</b>
				<p>Crafting offers that are strategically superior to the competition is key for long-lasting success on Amazon. Most sellers offer “me-too” products and are fighting for scraps.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Supply chain</b>
				<p>Running a professional supply chain that is consistent and produces world-class products at low-cost. Most sellers go out of stock, have quality issues and waste money.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Cash flow</b>
				<p>Maximizing the cash utilization in your business means faster growth and more profits. Most sellers experience slow growth due to poor usage of cash and low profit-margins.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Systems & data</b>
				<p>Building leveraged systems, designing your business for growth and using smart data. Most sellers hit a ceiling on growth due to a lack of structure, or one that doesn’t scale.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Paid advertising</b>
				<p>Constructing campaigns at scale, testing, optimizing, expanding market share, dominating your market! Most sellers are stuck in the stone-age with Amazon PPC.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Organic optimization</b>
				<p>Engineering product listings that rank for everything. Keyword usage and priority, indexation, page interactions, and more. Most sellers don’t make love to the machine.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Conversions & AOV</b>
				<p>Resonating with your market, creating offers that jump into the hands of new customers, architecting a higher AOV. Most sellers imitate and don’t know the art of salesmanship.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Hiring & managing a team</b>
				<p>Assembling a force and building a real business that runs and grows without you. Most sellers never decentralize, stay stuck and hire C-players that damage their business.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Operations</b>
				<p>Fine-tuning efficient, lean and transparent operations that deliver outstanding results. Most sellers build a bloated machine that drains profits and harms their ability to compete.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Scaling & automation</b>
				<p>Identifying leverage points, refining the right parts at the right time, increasing automation. Most sellers can’t scale because their business gets worse if it grows.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<b>Product evolution</b>
				<p>Constantly iterating and improving your products and selection over time. Moving into customization and innovation. Most sellers never add genuine value to the marketplace.</p>
			</li>
